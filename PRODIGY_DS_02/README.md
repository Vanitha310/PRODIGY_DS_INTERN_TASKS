# PRODIGY_DS_02

### For my second task with the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship, I analyzed the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival.

- Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Dataset Source: Prodigy InfoTech GitHub Repository

### Visualization 1 – Survival Count:
Compares the number of passengers who survived vs. those who did not.

### Visualization 2 – Age Distribution:
Shows the spread of passenger ages, revealing most travelers were between 20 and 40 years old.

### Visualization 3 – Survival Rate by Gender:
Highlights that females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

### Visualization 4 – Survival Rate by Passenger Class:
Indicates that first-class passengers had the highest survival chances, while third class had the lowest.

### Visualization 5 – Age vs Survival:
Suggests that younger passengers had a slightly better chance of survival.

### Visualization 6 – Correlation Heatmap:
Displays relationships between features, showing how passenger class, fare, and gender strongly correlated with survival.
