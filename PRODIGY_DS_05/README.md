# PRODIGY_DS_05

### As part of my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship, I analyzed the US Accidents dataset from Kaggle to identify accident patterns based on time of day, day of week, weather, and road conditions.

### Objective

Identify accident hotspots and contributing factors to improve road safety insights.

### Process

- Loaded & cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, parsed dates)

- Extracted time-based features (Hour, Day of Week, Month)

- Visualized accident trends by time, weather, and road conditions

- Identified high-risk locations using accident count analysis

- Created bar charts & heatmaps for better interpretation


### Results

- Most accidents occur on weekdays, especially Fridays

- Rush hours (7–8 AM, 4–6 PM) show peak accident rates

- Traffic signals, crossings, and junctions are common accident spots

- Fair & cloudy weather dominate accident conditions, not just bad weather events


### Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
