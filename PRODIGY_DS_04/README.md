# PRODIGY_DS_04

### As part of my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship, I analyzed social media data to understand public sentiment and trends around top gaming brands and topics. Using the dataset from Prodigy’s repo, I performed exploratory analysis and created visualizations to show overall sentiment distribution, the most mentioned entities, and sentiment breakdown per entity.

### Objective
Understand public opinion and sentiment patterns across tweets mentioning top entities.

### Key Visuals

- Overall sentiment distribution (Positive / Neutral / Negative / Irrelevant)

- Top 10 most-mentioned entities (bar chart)

- Sentiment distribution across those top entities (grouped bars)

- A stylized “circle with gradient” graphic for branding/thumbnail

### Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
### Dataset: Prodigy InfoTech GitHub – Task 04
