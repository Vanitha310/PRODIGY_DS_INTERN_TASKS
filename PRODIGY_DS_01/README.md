# PRODIGY_DS_01

### For my first task with the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship, I explored the World Bank population dataset to understand how populations are distributed globally and how India’s population has evolved over time.

- Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Dataset Source: Prodigy InfoTech GitHub Repository

### Visualization 1 – Population of India Over Time:
From 1960 to 2024, India’s population has shown a consistent upward trend, surpassing 1.4 billion in recent years.

### Visualization 2 – Population Distribution Across Countries (2020):
Most countries have relatively small populations, while a few nations have extremely large populations — creating a highly skewed distribution.
