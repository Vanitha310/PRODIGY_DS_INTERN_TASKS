# PRODIGY_DS_03

### As part of my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship, I built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Objective
Predict purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data.

### Process

- Loaded & explored the dataset

- Preprocessed categorical features using one-hot encoding

- Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split)

- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier with max_depth=5

- Visualized the decision-making process

### Results

- Accuracy: ~90.6%

- High precision for predicting non-purchasers

- Identified signs of class imbalance (fewer positive outcomes)

### Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
